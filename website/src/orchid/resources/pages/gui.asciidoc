== Launching the GUI

Run the GNU client by typing:

----
./gradlew gui:run

After launching the UI, the commandline is shown in the main window.
The commandline can be used to type KAP expressions and evaluate them
in the engine.

== Entering APL symbols

The GUI provides two ways of entering APL symbols:

- Hold kbd:[Alt] together with the appropriate key
- Type kbd:[.] followed by the appropriate key

The keymap can be displayed by selecting menu:Window[Keyboard]. This will
display a window with the keymap. Currently, the keymap will always display
a US keymap. Implementing support for other keymaps is easy, and help with
this effort would be appreciated.
